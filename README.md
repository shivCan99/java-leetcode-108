Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a  height-balanced  binary search tree.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation: [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
